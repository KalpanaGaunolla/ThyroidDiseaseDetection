# ThyroidDiseaseDetection

Thyroid disease a very common problem in India, more than one crore people are suffering with the disease every year. Thyroid disorder can speed up or slow down the metabolism of the body.

The main objective of this project is to predict if a person is having compensated hypothyroid, primary hypothyroid, secondary hypothyroid or negative (no thyroid) with the help of Machine Learning. Classification algorithms such as Logistic regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine have been trained on the thyroid dataset, UCI Machine Learning repository. Random Forest performed well with better accuracy (98%), precision and recall. After hyper parameter tuning, application has deployed on Heroku with the help of flask.
